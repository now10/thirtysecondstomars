If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>L. Headings<\/strong><br \/>\nThe section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Refunds, Credits, and Exchanges<\/strong><br \/>\nAll sales are final.

This will apply regardless of whether the error occurred because of human error or a transactional malfunction of the Site. We will not be liable for travel or any other expenses that you, or anyone else, incurs in connection with errors of this nature.
